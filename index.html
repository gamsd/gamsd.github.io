Currently I work as an engineering manager for Klarna in Berlin. Earlier, I worked as a senior engineer, technical leader or consultant to some of the largest companies in Brazil, such as TV Globo (media/news/entertainment), Vale (mining), Peixe Urbano (daily deals / marketplace) and VivaReal (real estate portal), as well as, more recently, Berlin-giant Zalando (ecommerce).</p><p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been working mostly in enabling legacy applications to scale, doing all of refactoring, rewriting and services breakdown, in a product-oriented way. I also do a fair share of programming languages and software architecture education and mentoring, to help enable my teams to work effectively in a microservices setting.</p><p>From my years on software, I had the chance to experience different facets of the software industry. My preferences, though, lie in building distributed fault-tolerant applications and developing teams. If you’re working on something exciting and think I may be of any help, drop me a line by email (gamsd at this domain) or ping me in any major social network.</p></div></main></div><footer class=site-footer><section class=aligned><a href=https://twitter.com/gamsd target=_blank><img src=/img/twitter.png></a>
